# AdrianShopify2022

Adrian's sumbission for Shopify's Data Science intern position!

Involves two files. File one "Summer 2022 Data Science Intern Challenge Question 1" is my approach and answer to Question 1 of the challenge questions. The Jupyter notebook file starts off with my approach/work, and at the end of the notebook are the answeres.
File two "Summer 2022 Data Science Intern Challenge Question 2" is a word doc, which includes the queries and the answers to the SQL questions of the challenge.
